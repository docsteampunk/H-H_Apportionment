# H-H_Apportionment
Recreated the Huntington-Hill in python for a world-building project.

The algorithm is O(N) complexity and follows standard coding practices. Requires a CSV file to enter in data. Said CSV should be laid out like this:
```
state,population
"Alabama",3893888
"Alaska",401851
"Arizona",2718215
```
The entries do not have to be in alphabetical order, the program does it at the end.
